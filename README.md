### Introduction 
 

Our app is a Study helper/ Event’s app for students who attend ATU. It has many features which will help improve the lives of university students.
One of the major features of the app is an event joining and creating feature. 
It includes an online noticeboard which shows all events coming up soon and an area to learn about finished events.
Users who wish to join events can input in the app which category’s they like (sport, meetups, yoga, etc.) and will receive notification’s when an event they may like gets posted. There is also an easy to use “Event Maker” tool.




Additionally, a lot of students, especially those with learning disabilities like ADHD, struggle with time management and staying on top of their college workload. 
Trying to manage multiple courses, assignments and continuous assessments can be overwhelming.
The app will also help students by sending push notifications directly to their phone, reminding them of upcoming classes, assignment deadlines, and exam dates, so they can keep up to date with their responsibilities without having to search the ATU website for information.  
Additionally, the app will allow students to track study time, set daily study goals, and see how much study time they are spending on each course, which can help manage their study time better.



Lastly, our app is a study helper and events platform created for ATU students, created to simplify academic tasks and increase people's social interaction via events. Features include an event discovery and creation tool, where students can view and receive notifications about events that they are interested in, like sports, coding, dancing, music etc.... The app also includes an event maker for easy event creation.
For studying, the app offers tools to help manage your time, sending notifications for upcoming classes, deadlines, and exams. International students and those managing busy schedules or conditions like ADHD can benefit from this app greatly by helping them set goals, keep track of study hours, and stay organized. This app enables ATU students to stay on top of responsibilities and meet others with shared interests.


## User Personas

Adam – Fourth Year Student – Event Organizer

Adam is a fourth-year student who works for the “University Event’s Board". He’s the head of event creation and often creates events for anyone in his age group who attends ATU.
He wants a simple platform to post the events he makes and let people join his events easily without having to spend extra time collecting RSVPs or add people to a list manually.
As someone who creates events of all kinds and categories, he would also love if people could follow the specific categories they like and get notifications when he posts a new event he makes.
He also wants an online notice board of sorts, which lists every event coming up and lets people learn about events that happened before.

Bob (second year computing student)  
 
Bob is a second year Computing student, who has a learning disability (ADHD), and wants a way to keep track of his study time, course work, assignments due, and exams dates throughout the semester.   
If he could receive notifications to his phone about approaching class times and room location, assignments due and upcoming CA exams, this would relieve a lot of stress and time spent looking for class timetables, and exam dates on the ATU website.  
It would also be helpful if he could track his daily study time on a time tracking app, which would allow him to create estimated time needed to study for a particular assignment, set up daily study goals, and track his overall time spent studying, which would alleviate the pressure of underestimating the study time needed for each course, which often leads to leaving assignments to the last minute.
